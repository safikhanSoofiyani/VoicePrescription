<h1> Voice Prescription</h1>
An easy to use tool for doctors. This application utilizes the power of Google's state of the art speech recognition and speech to text conversion model and incorporates
these in order to generate well formatted prescriptions. The doctor, instead of writing prescriptions, just speaks to this mobile application. The app records everything and automatically generates a well formatted prescription. The doctor now has an option to send this precription to the patient either via email or via SMS directly from the app itself.

This small step towards automation greatly reduces the work of the doctor as well as the patient. The application also stores all the previosly generated prescriptions in the form of a PDF file and can be accessed by the doctor whenever required.
